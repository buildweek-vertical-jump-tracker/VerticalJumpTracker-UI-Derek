# VerticalJumpTracker-UI-Derek

Vertical Jump Tracker is an app that is designed to be help the user gain inches onto their vertical jump. More than just a list of exercises, VJT is involved in the early planning, and motivation throughout the process. The app takes some initial data in, such as bodily measurements, and goals. In this case the goal would be the amount of inches the user would like to gain on their vertical. Once that data is added, VJT will devise a plan spanning the course of weeks, and along the way it will keep track of daily progress. Users will be able to view and chart their progress along the way, serving as a great source of motivation.

Some of the features include:

-customized reminders that will prompt the user to complete the prescribed workouts
-Homepage that provides users with the chart of their progress over time along with their goals they had set.
-Modals that provide positive feedback to the user as a form of encouragement and motivation.
-A workout regimen that is carefully constructed to increase the users vertical by using a full body approach.
