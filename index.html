          <p class="main-p">
            Achieving physically demanding, athletic goals can be daunting. That
            is why Vert-Tracker is a multi-faceted application that encompasses
            the most important parts of the process, including motivation and
            strategic planning. Vert-Tracker will prompt you to get to work on a
            regular basis and give positive feedback when you complete workouts.
            All the while, your progress will be charted and mapped out for you
            to see and make the right adjustments to hit the goals you desire.

          <p class="main-p">
            Just enter some simple data (Height, weight, etc.) and test your
            current vertical, and let us take care of the rest. You can set a
            goal for inches you would like to gain on your vertical and
            Vert-Tracker will supply you with a number of weeks it will take to
            reach that goal.

          <p class="main-p">
            The workout plan that is devised will be a full body strength
            program that is specifically targeting the parts of the body that
            contribute to vertical jump height. The weekly routines will
            constantly change and take into account the gains that have been
            achieved to that point. Examples of some of the workouts include:
            squats, Romanian Deadlifts, Single-Arm Dumbbell Rows, and many more.
